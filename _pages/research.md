Here are some more specific (randomly ordered) research topics I'm interested in... 

### Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars

- S-type stars and carbon stars
- s-process and the third dredge-up
- Pulsation and mass-loss on the AGB

### Stellar variability

- Long period variable (LPV) stars, particularly semiregular and Mira variables
- Long secondary periods of LPVs
- Side interests: Type II Cepheids (especially RV Tauri variables), red supergiant (RSG) variables

### Low-mass stellar evolution

- Detailed stellar evolution codes, eg. the [Monash stellar evolution code](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007PASA...24..103K/abstract), [Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)](https://mesastar.org/)
- Thermohaline mixing on the red giant branch
- Side interests: Li-rich giants, carbon deficient giants (CDGs)

### Astrophysical time-series

- Analysis of variable star light curves
- Gaussian process regression
- Large photometric surveys
