Hi, I'm Yoshi. Welcome to my research page!

I'm currently a PhD student at Monash University, researching stellar astrophysics. 

I was previously part of the ARC Centre of Excellence [ASTRO 3D](https://astro3d.org.au/), and I'm currently an Australian Junior Associate in the LSST Discovery Alliance as part of Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

Some more specific (and randomly ordered) things I'm interested in include...

- Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars
    - S-type stars and carbon stars
    - s-process and the third dredge-up
    - Pulsation and mass-loss on the AGB

- Stellar variability
    - Long period variable (LPV) stars, particularly semiregular and Mira variables
    - Long secondary periods of LPVs
    - Side interests: Type II Cepheids (especially RV Tauri variables), red supergiant (RSG) variables

- Low-mass stellar evolution
    - Detailed stellar evolution codes, eg. the [Monash stellar evolution code](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007PASA...24..103K/abstract), [Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)](https://mesastar.org/)
    - Thermohaline mixing on the red giant branch
    - Side interests: Li-rich giants, carbon deficient giants (CDGs)

- Astrophysical time-series
    - Analysis of variable star light curves
    - Gaussian process regression
