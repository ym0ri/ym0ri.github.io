#### Hi, I'm Yoshi. Welcome to my research page!

I'm currently a PhD student at Monash University, researching stellar astrophysics.

My current interests are in old, red giant stars known as asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. You can find more specific research interests of mine in [research](/research/).

I was previously part of the ARC Centre of Excellence [ASTRO 3D](https://astro3d.org.au/), and I'm currently an Australian Junior Associate in the LSST Discovery Alliance as part of [Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://rubinobservatory.org/).

On this website, you'll find my [publications](/publications/) and [talks](/talks/), as well as more details and handy links related to my research in [resources](/resources/).
