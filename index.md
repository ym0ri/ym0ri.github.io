Hi, I'm Yoshi. 

I'm a PhD student at Monash University, researching stellar astrophysics.

Some more specific things I am interested in are:

- Low-mass stellar evolution
    - The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, s-process and third dredge up
    - Carbon stars and S-type stars
    - Stellar evolution codes
    - Stellar pulsation on the AGB
    - Thermohaline mixing on the red giant branch
