Hi, I'm Yoshi. Welcome to my research page!

I'm a PhD student at Monash University, researching stellar astrophysics.

Some specific (and randomly ordered) things I am interested in include...

- Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars
    - s-process and the third dredge-up
    - Carbon stars and S-type stars

- Stellar variability
    - Pulsation in long period variable (LPV) stars
    - Long secondary periods in LPVs (what exactly causes them?)

- Low-mass stellar evolution
    - Detailed stellar evolution codes
    - Thermohaline mixing on the red giant branch

- Astrophysical time-series
    - Analysis of variable star light curves
    - Gaussian process regression

On this website, you'll find my [publications](/publications/) and [talks](/talks/), as well as more details and handy links related to my [research](/research).

<!-- I also like to play music, and dabble in various instruments!
 
You may also see me playing Japanese drums (taiko) at your local Japanese festival or event.  -->
